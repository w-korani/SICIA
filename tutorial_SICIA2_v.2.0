The folder containing images is set in 'Input/Output' panel.
Images' types should be setting by user, the default is jpg. The analysis will done only for files having the set extenstion.
output folder and file should be set in 'Input/Output' panel.
level, noise, filter, scale and invert_image should be set for infection and background:
  it is tested by Test_cutoffs button.
  Set buttons are used to set the selected parameters to infection or backgound.
  Refresh buttons are used to allow user to re-set the parameters to infection of background
It is preferable to set the background paramaters before the infection
In some cases, when the infection pattern has colours close to the backgound of the orginal images (such as darkbrown and black), 
  Image-subtraction is used to solve the issue, it is only availabe to infection.
If the user has scale, it should be in the UPPER LEFT corner of the image and the diameter can be set in milimeters. 
  the default is 26.5 mm which is the diameter of USA 1 dollar coin.
  
  
The output folder contains:
1. The orginal image
2. The filter image
3. The infection pattern
4. the alignment of the infection to the backgound

The output file is a CSV spread sheet file contains the following fields
1. The image ID
2. The back size (in mm2)
3. The infection size (in mm2)
4. The coverage percentage of the coverage infection to the seed scope
5. The intensity of the infection
6. The number of objects
7. The average intensity: normalizing the intensity to the number of objects
note: if the user unchecks the 'scale' checkbox, fields 2, 3, will not be generated in the csv file.
note2: paramters 6 and 7 are used to count and normalze to number of infected leaves, seeds, stem, or any plant parts used in the image,
       therfore, if the number of object is differnt than number of plant parts in the original image, 
       the user should re-analyze and use more suitable settings
       
Note, Although, the program can deal with differnt single color background images, the black background is preferable.

Testing the program:
A set of input files are available in the 'program files' folder of the windows under the following path \UGA\SICIA_2.0\application\input_test.
the outputs are available too.


the testing data is run fine with the following paramters:

Stem infection:

background: levels = 0.3, noise = 1000, filter=Grey
infection: levels=0.55, noise = 1000, filter =Blue, image_substraction enabled

Single leaf infection:

infection: levels=0.6, noise = 20, filter =Grey

Multi leaves infection:
